This file describes how run_analysis.R script works.
1.Download the dataset from project website and unzip it to your computer. 
2.Open the "run_analysis" script in RStudio, set up a working directory and change all other directories/paths for the datasets in the "run_analysis" script accordingly.
3.After making sure you have specified correctly all the working directories/paths, run the script and you will get two datasets "tidydata1" and "averagedataset" and the latter is the one we need to get according to the project instruction.
